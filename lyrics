Verse 1:
i looked at memories there's something that i miss. it's something simple, could it be the way we kissed? it's all behind you as you set out on your road, a vanquished feeling deep inside your very soul 

not a moment passes when it doesnt cross my mind, and I drift from place to place looking for a sign. a sign of hope against the ever pouring rain, i need to know if i will ever feel the same?

chorus: 
could it be you were wrong when you said we were through? and i know all those words you believe they are true

Verse 2:
i spent so long curled up deep inside my head that i forgot the bad times and the ugly words we said. it's far too easy to remember everything in gold, we're better off apart the honest truth be told.

we sail the ocean once created in our mind. we're searching deep inside for something most never find. an empty place where something beautiful once had been. to realise that it was nothing but a dream.

chorus: 
could it be you were wrong when you said we were through? and i know all those words you believe they are true.

I was wrong to believe what i once felt for you. Now i know it's the end, we are done. through and through.
